## Product info

A virtual art gallery that allows artists to exhibit and sell their artwork, and visitors to contemplate and buy them, and both to directly message each other.  

## Project description

<details><summary>Origin</summary>
 <p>Back in France in 2019 not long before the first lockdown, I couldn't go out anymore. Bye exhibitions and galleries, it left my soul more and more empty. If I could at least contemplate artworks, be touched, and escape the social media life...</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Pain points</summary>
  <ul>
   <li>Difficult accessibility to artwork exhibition and sales for the artists : art gallery for being mostly elitist, hard to be known, creative and cultural industries complexity.</li>
   <li>With covid, we now know it's possible that we can't go out anymore. </li>
   <li>Galleries' physical limits : space limit (ex : too many visitors in an exhibition space), entry limit, artwork/artist exhibition limit, geographic location.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details><summary>Solutions</summary>
 <p>A web app that democratizes art exhibition and artworks sales, by making it very accessible.</p>
